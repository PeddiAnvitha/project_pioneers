Introduction:
The college examination branch plays a pivotal role in managing and streamlining academic and examination-related operations. Leveraging modern tools and cloud services such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), the system ensures scalability, security, and efficiency. This abstract outlines the key components and functionalities of a robust examination branch system.






Objective:
The objective of this project is to design and develop a robust, scalable, and efficient website for the college examination branch, leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) to optimize performance, security, and user experience. It enables features such as exam schedules, results management and notifications. By utilizing AWS services like EC2, S3 the system will ensure high availability, data security with existing administrative processes.
